## Overview

Synthetic Tabular Data Generator is a modern, professional web application for generating high-quality synthetic tabular datasets using advanced generative AI modelsâ€”CTGAN and TabDDPM. This tool preserves the statistical properties of your original data while anonymizing sensitive information, making it ideal for privacy-preserving data augmentation, testing, and analysis.

The app is built with Python, leveraging PyTorch for modeling, the Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) library, and Streamlit for a sleek and responsive user interface with smooth animations and modern glassmorphism design.

## Features

- Upload custom CSV datasets or use provided sample datasets (Iris, Titanic, Adult)
- Two powerful generative models: CTGAN and TabDDPM
- Comprehensive training configuration (epochs, batch size, learning rate)
- Real-time training progress and loss visualization
- Synthetic data generation with customizable sample size
- Statistical comparison dashboard including KS test, correlation matrices, PCA overlays
- Export synthetic datasets as CSV and trained models as pickle files
- Responsive and visually stunning interface with animations and interactive charts
